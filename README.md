# High-Volume Order Fulfillment System

## Introduction

* This document outlines the design and implementation approach for a high-volume order fulfillment system that handles 
more than 100,000 concurrent orders per second. 
* The system will feature real-time stock updates and guaranteed order
delivery from the nearest warehouse. 

## Architecture Overview

### Key Features
1. **High Throughput**: The system must handle over 100,000 concurrent orders per second.
2. **Order Fulfillment**: Orders should be fulfilled from multiple warehouses, starting with the nearest.
3. **Real-Time Stock Updates**: Stock levels must be updated in real-time to reflect current availability.
4. **Guaranteed Order Delivery**: Ensure that every order is completed and delivered.

### Microservices Architecture
1. **Order Service**: Manages order creation, processing, and tracking.
2. **Inventory Service**: Manages stock levels and updates across multiple warehouses.
3. **Warehouse Service**: Manages warehouse-specific operations, including order fulfillment and stock updates.
4. **Notification Service**: Handles notifications for order confirmations, shipping updates, and deliveries.
5. **Gateway Service**: Acts as an entry point for all client requests, managing load balancing and routing.

### Database Design
1. **Order Database**: PostgreSQL
2. **Inventory & Warehouse Database**: MongoDB
3. **Caching Layer**: Redis
4. **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ

## Key Components

### Order Service
- **Endpoint**: `POST /orders`
- **Parameters**:
    - `productId`: ID of the product to order.
    - `quantity`: Quantity of the product.
    - `customerLocation`: Location of the customer.
- **Process**:
    1. Validate the order details.
    2. Determine the nearest warehouse with available stock.
    3. Create an order record in the Order Database.
    4. Reserve the stock in the Inventory Service.
    5. Send order confirmation to the Notification Service.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "orderId": "12345",
    "status": "confirmed",
    "estimatedDelivery": "2024-07-25"
  }


###  Inventory Service
- **Endpoint**: `GET /inventory`
- **Parameters**:
    - `productId`: ID of the product.
- **Process**:
    1. Fetch the current stock levels from all warehouses.
    2. Return the stock levels.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
  "productId": "67890",
  "stockLevels": [
    { "warehouseId": "1", "quantity": 100 },
    { "warehouseId": "2", "quantity": 50 }
  ]
  }

- **Endpoint**: `POST /inventory/reserve`
- **Parameters**:
  - `productId`: ID of the product.
  - `warehouseId`: ID of the warehouse.
  - `quantity`: Quantity to reserve.
- **Process**:
  1. Reserve the specified quantity in the specified warehouse.
  2. Update the stock level in the Inventory Database.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Stock reserved successfully"
  }


###  Warehouse Service
- **Endpoint**: `POST /warehouse/fulfill`
- **Parameters**:
  - `orderId`: ID of the order.
  -  `warehouseId`: ID of the warehouse fulfilling the order.
- **Process**:
  1. Fetch order details from the Order Database.
  2. Pick and pack the order in the warehouse.
  3. Update the order status to 'shipped' in the Order Database.
  4. Send shipping notification to the Notification Service.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Order fulfilled successfully"
  }


###  Notification Service
- **Endpoint**: `POST /notifications`
- **Parameters**:
  - `orderId`: ID of the order.
  -  `message`: Notification message.
- **Process**:
  1. Send the notification to the customer via email/SMS.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Notification sent successfully"
  }


## Concurrency and Scalability
1. Load Balancing: Distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of each service using load balancers.
2. Database Sharding: Distribute data across multiple databases to handle high read/write loads.
3. Caching: Use in-memory caching (e.g. **Redis**) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
4. Message Queues: Use message queues (e.g., **RabbitMQ**, **Kafka**) for asynchronous processing of tasks like order processing and notifications.
5. Horizontal Scaling: Scale each service horizontally by adding more instances as load increases.

## Fault Tolerance and Reliability
1. Retry Mechanisms: Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures in inter-service communication.
2. Circuit Breakers: Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures in case of service outages.
3. Data Replication: Ensure data replication across multiple servers/databases to prevent data loss.
4. Monitoring and Alerts: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to issues promptly.


# Implementation Notes

## Database
- Given the requirements of the task and the nature of the data, it might make sense to use a SQL database for the
Order service while keeping NoSQL databases for the Inventory and Warehouse services.

### Order Database
- **Recommended Database**: PostgreSQL
- Reasons:
  * ACID Compliance: Ensures data consistency and reliability, which is critical for handling financial transactions and order states.
  *  Scalability: Can be scaled horizontally with sharding and read replicas.
  *  Advanced Features: Supports complex queries and indexing, which can be useful for order tracking and reporting.

### Warehouse & Inventory Database
- **Recommended Database**: MongoDB
- Reasons:
  * Document-Oriented: Suitable for storing flexible and hierarchical data structures, such as warehouse details and inventory.
  *  Horizontal Scalability: Easily scales out with sharding, which is ideal for managing large volumes of data distributed across multiple warehouses.
  *  High Performance: Provides high throughput for read and write operations.
